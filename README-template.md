# Frontend Mentor - Suite landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Suite landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/suite-landing-page-tj_eaU-Ra). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
